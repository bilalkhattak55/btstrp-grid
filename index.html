            <h6 class="my-2"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
              so,
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            <h6 class="my-2">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h6>

              “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
              for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

            <h6 class="my-2">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
              them and
              learning from their experiences was easy.</h6>
            <p>
              “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
              an incredible community of mdart and amazing people. ”

          <h6 class="my-2">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h6>
          <p>
            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
